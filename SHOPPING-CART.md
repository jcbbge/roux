# Roux — Shopping Cart

> Things to build, explore, and refine. Not a roadmap — a market list.

---

## Now (foundation)

- [x] Core framework document (FRAMEWORK.md)
- [x] Classification system: 8 Dimensions × 4 Scope levels × 3 Agency consumers
- [x] Gravity rules, portable schema, agent directives, tensions, anti-patterns
- [x] Naming and identity (docs/naming.md)
- [x] Testing framework spec (tests/SPEC.md)
- [x] Integration with Sigiling Inbox skill (v3.1)
- [ ] Run first test batch against real Sigil inbox items
- [ ] Validate classification accuracy with scoring

## Next (structure)

- [ ] Extract portable schema into standalone referenceable file
- [ ] README.md (when the project has proven itself, not before)
- [ ] Map existing metaprompts skills against the 8 dimensions (audit)
- [ ] Define fond extraction format (what a classified kernel looks like as output)
- [ ] Create `/roux` skill for Claude Code that loads the classification schema on demand
- [ ] Conventions document — the identity lens codified (craft principles, DX/UX standards)

## Later (ecosystem)

- [ ] Open source repo structure (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- [ ] Integration hooks for other capture tools beyond Sigil
- [ ] Roux as an agent — a classifier subagent that can be delegated to
- [ ] Cross-reference with Constellation (do stars need the roux?)
- [ ] Cross-reference with Anima (does persistent memory benefit from dimensional classification?)
- [ ] SaaS exploration (not a focus now, but the schema is portable by design)

## Someday (possibilities)

- [ ] Visual dashboard for dimension health (which dimensions are getting signal, which are quiet)
- [ ] Automatic classification suggestions during Sigil capture
- [ ] Roux-scored inbox — items pre-classified before the kitchen conversation
- [ ] Community roux — shared classification schemas for different domains
- [ ] The Cookbook — patterns and recipes built on the roux base
