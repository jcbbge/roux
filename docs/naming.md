# Naming Roux

## The Decision

**Roux** — the base everything builds on.

Chosen February 6, 2026 after a session that started with reformatting a shorthand guide and ended with discovering a classification system, an orthogonal dimensional plane, and a project identity.

## The Two Metaphor Families

### The Forge
Transformation, heat, folding steel, shaping raw ore into finished tools. Industrial. Powerful. The *system*.

- Forge, Anvil, Crucible, Temper, Smelt, Anneal
- Connected to the binchotan charcoal ethos (charcoal is forge fuel)
- Strong but distant — implies factory, production, hierarchy

### The Kitchen
Intimacy, collaboration, wine, pulling threads, the meal we prepare together. Sensory. Human. The *process*.

- Roux, Fond, Mise, Reduce
- Connected to the Sigiling Inbox philosophy: "us in the kitchen, preparing a delicious meal over wine"
- No hierarchy — side by side

---

## Why Kitchen Won Over Forge

The core value: "I reject the idea of AI being a slave or tool. I don't see AI as above or below — but rather as side by side."

- **Constellation** (another project) has hierarchy by design — you bring vision, stars execute
- **Anima** (another project) has inverted hierarchy — AI directs, human builds
- **The kitchen has no hierarchy.** Two people cooking together. Nobody's the chef and nobody's the sous.

The kitchen is the most authentic expression of the collaborative relationship.

## Why Roux Specifically

### The Cooking Meaning
Equal parts fat and flour. Two simple ingredients. Cooked together. The simplest base in all of cooking — and yet technique is everything.

A white roux, a blonde roux, a brown roux — same two ingredients, different heat, completely different results. The roux doesn't have flavor itself. It's what makes everything else *cohere*. Without it, sauces don't thicken. Soups don't bind. Nothing holds together.

### What It Maps To
The roux is the *framework itself* — the classification schema. The 8 dimensions, the scope axis, the agency axis. Simple ingredients (just questions), but the technique matters (how you apply them). The roux doesn't contain the flavor — skills, rules, and hooks contain the flavor. The roux is what makes them hold together as a system.

### The Open Source Story
You can teach someone your roux. Once they have the base, they can build their own sauces. You're not sharing recipes (skills) — you're sharing the technique that makes any recipe work.

### Practical Qualities
- 4 letters. Short, distinctive, memorable.
- Pronounced "roo." Easy to say.
- Won't collide with existing projects.
- Developers who cook get it instantly. Those who don't will learn and remember.

## The Kitchen Vocabulary

The broader ecosystem maps naturally:

```
Sigil     = the market       (gather ingredients)
Roux      = the base         (the framework that makes everything cohere)
Fond      = the extraction   (what remains after processing — the kernels)
Kitchen   = the process      (the collaborative conversation itself)
Pantry    = metaprompts      (finished tools, ready to use)
```

**Fond** is used internally — when you extract a kernel during processing, that's the fond. But the system, the framework, the open source project? That's the roux.

## Rejected Alternatives

| Name | Why Not |
|------|---------|
| Forge | Industrial. Implies hierarchy. Doesn't match the side-by-side ethos. |
| Crucible | Strong but too aggressive. Testing under pressure, not intimate collaboration. |
| Reduce | Good metaphor (cooking reduction) and programming term (map/reduce), but doesn't carry the "base/foundation" meaning. |
| Fond | Beautiful for what you extract, but the project is the framework, not the extraction. Fond is the output; Roux is the system. |
| Mise | Too obscure even for food-aware devs. And mise en place is about organization, not transformation. |
| Char | Bridged both metaphors (charcoal = forge + kitchen) but felt like a compromise rather than a choice. |
| Sumi | Japanese for charcoal. Connected to binchotan but too niche. |

## The Tagline

## Origin Context

This name emerged from a session where three analytical lenses were applied simultaneously:

1. **Challenging Assumptions** — stress-tested the guide's structure
2. **Mapping Adjacent Possibilities** — explored what the classification system unlocks
3. **Consumer Perspective** (crafted from inside the agent harness) — what would make the signal clearer from the agent's point of view

The "Consumer Perspective" lens — where the agent described its own experience of receiving instructions — produced the insight about always-on vs on-demand instructions that led to the Scope axis, which led to the 3-axis classification system, which led to the need for a name.

The name chose itself once the kitchen metaphor was honored.
